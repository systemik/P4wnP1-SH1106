Pi hat with SH1106 to drive P4wnP1

Based on excellent work from Stephan Hahn . : http://stephanhahn.ch/posts/p4wnp1-oled-bonnet-mod/

Use luma.oled drivers instead of adafruit SSH1306 drivers.

Follow Stephan method but install luma driver from here : https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled

Installation of libraries  https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
